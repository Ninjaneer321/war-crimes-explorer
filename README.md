# War Crimes Explorer

The War Crimes Explorer idea:

* In-browser learning about genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and aggression.
* Interactively enter facts and discover the laws that might have been broken.
* Possibly submit the information to the ICC (International Criminal Court) as a witness statement.

## Other implementation ideas
* [Tau Prolog](http://tau-prolog.org) runs in the browser.
* There's a Prolog implementation for Erlang; that could run a browser app.
* CLIPS is another option. Maybe it could run in the browser via a [clipspy](https://github.com/noxdafox/clipspy) server?
* [Vaticle Type DB](https://vaticle.com/) is another possibility. It supports inference explanations, but I couldn't find any info about web clients.
* Writing this as a simulation using Typescript, Elm, or Phoenix Live View.
* What else? Some kind of very intelligent chatbot framework?
